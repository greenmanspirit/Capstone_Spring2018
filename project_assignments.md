# Project Assignments

Please file your top THREE choices as an issue (will go over in class) by Wednesday () morning at 11:59 AM (i.e., right before noon).  Please list them in the order that you prefer them.  You will be informed as to your project during the next Capstone class on Friday 8 Sep.  If you do not file an issue by then, I will assume you do not care which project you are on and I will place uncommitted students on whichever projects still need people.

Along with your selections, please include any qualifications or specific reasons for interest that you have for those specific projects.   Remember that you are "interviewing" for the project against others, especially if you have selected popular projects.   Students who respond early also show enthusiasm for the projects, which goes a long way to showing that they actually want to do them.

I will attempt to place you in one of your top three choices.  Last semester, every student got into one of their top three (and a majority into their #1 choice), although I do not make any guarantees.


Note: Some of you are working on private projects

## Industry Assignments

### Yelp

_Yelp Chatbot_ - Yelp will support a student team in building a chatbot using our public API (https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3) to provide suggestions and information about local businesses. For example, the bot might suggest a local restaurant when it detects a chat conversation about where to go for lunch. The possibilities are endless--be creative!  This can be built for any popular chat service, and can be implemented in any technology stack.  The resulting design and code will belong to the students. Our goals are to tap student creativity in exploring new ways of using Yelp, to get to know a talented team of students, and to support those students in building something cool and useful. About Yelp: Yelp is one of the world's top web and mobile development organizations. We have a strong internship program at our San Francisco headquarters and we hire lots of new college grads. Our Pittsburgh office is at Forbes and Meyran, practically in the midst of Pitt's campus. Our local engineering team includes Pitt alums, experienced entrepreneurs, and Carnegie Mellon alums.

### NetApp



### Viz

_Window Shopping for Data_ - Most people are familiar with the Google approach to search the internet for sources. That works well for an internet-scale repository. When attempting to do a search on a small repository, the user has to play the game of “guess the magic word” as the user is unaware of what is in the repository. The worst situation is when the system returns a result to say there is nothing that matches the search term— is it really the case or did the user not guess the right magic word.

A contrasting approach would be to browse through the repository to find a document of interest. A “window shopping” analogy. While there are some e-Discovery tools that support this approach, they are often specific to a particular domain which does not make them very suitable for a general audience. They are also very heavyweight for each repository and does not scale for multiple repositories. We have text analysis tools that will provide lots of lists of the contents of a repository, but that does not help a user. We are looking for a means to convert those lists into a form that is more useful to a user who needs to find something.

## Open-Source

### WordPress

_Gutenberg_ - Gutenberg is a new editor experience for WordPress, the open source software used by more than 29% of the internet for creating beautiful websites, blogs, or apps. The goal of the Gutenberg project is to create a new content editing experience that makes it easy for anyone to create rich post and page layouts. It is in active development on GitHub under the WordPress organization. Students will take on the responsibility of developing features for the project, resolving bugs, performing code review, and participating in the discussions which occur in GitHub issues and in the WordPress development Slack instance.

## Faculty Projects

## Bioinformatics-focused

These projects have a focus on bioinformatics specifically.  Preference is given to BIOSC1640 or CS1640-registered students, or those with a background in bioinformatics or a related discipline.  This does not mean that you cannot sign up for them if you are not in one of those classes, however!
