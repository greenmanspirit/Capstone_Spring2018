# CS CAPSTONE
Fall Semester 2017

DUE DATE: (VARIES) - Date selected by student

## Project Students (CS1980/CS1981/CS1640/BIOSC1640)

Your presentation will be approximately 10 minutes.  It will be on either 1 Dec or 8 Dec.  You do not get to choose which date; all groups should be prepared to give a presentation on 1 December.  Depending on how far we get, you may or may not give the presentation that day.

This presentation should generally include a demo of the software on which you worked.

## Internship / Research Students (CS1900/CS1950)

Your presentation will be 5 to 10 minutes.  It will be on one of the following dates:

* 15 Sep
* 29 Sep
* 13 Oct
* 27 Oct
* 10 Nov
* 17 Nov
* 1 Dec
* 8 Dec

You can choose a _preferred_ date by 6 September by creating an _issue_ on the class GitHub repo ( https://github.com/laboon/Capstone_Fall2017 ).  Note that this is a _preferred_, not _guaranteed_ date.  I will do my best to put any student who asks for a specific date on that date on a first-come, first-served basis.

Instructions for selecting a preferred date or dates:

1. If you do not have one, create a GitHub account.  This is free.  You may want to sign up for the student education pack (which is also free).  It contains lots of free tech goodies.  https://education.github.com/
2. Go to the class repo: https://github.com/laboon/Capstone_Fall2017
3. Click on the "Issues" tab
4. Click the green "New Issue" button
5. The title textbox should contain your full name (e.g., "Bill Laboon")
6. The comment textbox should contain which date you would like to give your presentation.  You may list several dates (up to three) listed in preferential order (i.e., the first date is the date you would most like to go).
7. Click the green "Submit New Issue" button
8. You may verify that your request was submitted by clicking on the "Issues" tab of the repo and seeing your name
9. I will assign your date before class starts on 8 September.  I will close your issue, if you have created an issue, at that time.  Final dates will be displayed in the file presentation_schedule.md in the root directory of the repository.

Presentation dates will be listed in the class repository by the beginning of class on 8 September.  Since the first presentation date is 15 September, this will give you at _least_ one week to prepare.  If you are concerned about going this early, make sure to set a different date ASAP.
